**STANDUP**

Prominent early work in pun-generation:
JAPE (90s)
STANDUP (00s)

Both rely on "schemas, description rules, and templates"

schema - linguistic rules relating sets of words in potentially-humorous ways (double-entendres)
templates - fitting the linguistic pieces together in an e.g. 'what do you call a' format

"There are various restrictions about which question templates are compatible with which answer templates, and also which templates are viable for the values coming from a particular schema. These combi- nations are coded up in a table; these are known as the joke types, as we found it useful to characterize types of joke in terms of underlying rule combinations."
